# Procedural Image Based Scattering

Exploration into procedurally scattering cubes based on a reference image, and scaling them to compositionally balance each other. This project was made with Unity.

## Description
Given a reference image and an arbitrary starting point, this algorithm aims to scatter points that flow along related colors of the image. The next cubeâ€™s position is chosen to be one of 8 neighboring points ( at a given step size ) that minimizes the following two values:

  * Difference in color value.
  
  * Dot product of the previous and current direction of motion. This is so that the cubes are inclined to move in a flowing pattern.

Then the cubes size is calculated by maximizing the equilibrium of the position and sizes of the previous N cubes, following the logic of the talk <a href ="https://vimeo.com/261901560">Creativity of Rules and Patterns: Designing Procedural Systems</a>.

The results are interesting, but in the future I would like to take this exploration and tune it for a specific goal, such as alien cities, forests, or caves. It would also be cool to optimize the problem for a first person view, instead of only thinking of the 2D top down scattering problem.

## Usage

Open the Demo scene in the Unity project, and press play. You can move around the sphere and press G to generate a new scattering starting at the cubes position. 

### Parameter Overview

**Basic**

`Reference Tex` - replace this image with the desired reference image. You should also replace the image in the `Base Plane` Material if you want to visualize the texture behind the generation.

`Cube Mat` - the material for the generated cubes. 

`Starting Pos Helper` - the game object who's position determines the starting point of the algorithm. 

`Generated Cube Count`- how many cubes to generate. 


**Scattering** 

`Flow Amount` - how much weight should be on the angular difference during minimization. 

`Step Size` - how far away the neighboring points should be sampled. 
Randomness - how much randomness to apply to the neighboring point sampling. 


**Scaling**

`Cubes To Balance` - the number of previous cubes to bring to equillibrium when calculating the current cube scale.

`Cycle Scale` - check this if you want the scales to be randomly cycled.
